# STATIC MALWARE ANALYSIS
<h2>${\textsf{\color{green}DESCRIPTION}}$</h2>
<a>
Static malware analysis is a method used in cybersecurity to dissect and understand malicious software without executing it. It involves examining the code or binary of a potentially harmful program to identify its behavior, functions, and potential threats. Analysts scrutinize the structure, syntax, and patterns within the code to uncover indicators of compromise, such as suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or known malware signatures. This approach allows cybersecurity professionals to assess the nature and potential impact of malware before it can wreak havoc on systems or networks, enabling proactive defense measures and informed decision-making to mitigate risks.</a>

<h2>${\textsf{\color{green}OBJECTIVES}}$</h2>
<body>
<ul>
<li>Identifying the file type (Target OS, architecture and format)</li>
<li>Identifying the malware (Generating a has of the malware and see if anyone else has analyzed the malware)</li>
<li>Strings (Give us an idea of what the malware can do)</li>
<li>Unpacking and deobfuscating to reveal information</li>
<li>PE Headers reveal a lot of information on the malware functionality.</li>
</ul>
